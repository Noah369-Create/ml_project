# Kidney Disease Classification Using Ultrasound Images

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application for classifying kidney diseases using ultrasound (US) images. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and diagnose potential kidney conditions.

## Features
- Upload ultrasound images for kidney disease classification
- Preprocessing pipeline for image enhancement
- Machine learning model for classification
- Web-based user interface for easy access and interaction

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Flask / Django
- **Frontend:** React.js / HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 / Firebase (if applicable)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Node.js (if using React for frontend)
- Docker (optional for containerization)

### Steps to Set Up
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kidney-disease-classification.git
   cd kidney-disease-classification
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py  # or the appropriate command for your framework
   ```
5. (If applicable) Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Model Training
1. Prepare your dataset and store it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```sh
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
4. Save and export the trained model:
   ```sh
   python export_model.py
   ```

## Deployment
### Local Deployment
Run the Flask/Django server:
```sh
python app.py
```

### Docker Deployment
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t kidney-classification .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 5000:5000 kidney-classification
   ```

### Cloud Deployment (Optional)
Deploy the model and web application on AWS, GCP, or Heroku for public access.
